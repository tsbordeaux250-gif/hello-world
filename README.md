This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I thought I'd take this time to mention that this is my first semester trying to both attend school, but also maintain a job. I don't expect leeway, but I wanted to give explanation for why this assignment got around so late. Other than that, this class has been so enjoyable for me, thank you!
